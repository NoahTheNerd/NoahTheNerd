# Temurin Installation
This guide will show you how to install **Adoptium Temurin**, as simple as possible.

First, please click the follow link for your operating system.
- üíô [Microsoft Windows (Most PCs)](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin8-binaries/releases/download/jdk8u372-b07/OpenJDK8U-jre_x64_windows_hotspot_8u372b07.msi)
- üçé [MacOS (for Macbook, iMac, etc)](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin8-binaries/releases/download/jdk8u372-b07/OpenJDK8U-jre_x64_mac_hotspot_8u372b07.pkg)


## üíô Windows
Open your `.msi` file from the link above. It will open a menu somewhat like the one on screen right now.

Click the <kbd>Next</kbd> button to proceed.

On the next page, you will see this. If you click on the JRE with Hotspot text, you can see the location as highlighted in yellow below.

You want to save this. You can take a screenshot using <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>. Just drag a square over it. It will copy the image to your clipboard and give a notification which you can click to open a window with your saved image. 

Now, press <kbd>Next</kbd> and click <kbd>Install</kbd>. Temurin will now install itself!


## üçé MacOS
I don't spend absurd amounts of money on a Mac. Sorry, I'll ask my Apple simps how they do it later.

## üß© Adding to Minecraft
### Regular Minecraft Launcher
Open your Minecraft Launcher and click <kbd>Installations</kbd> on the top.

Edit the instance you use ChatTriggers on, this will let you modify it's settings.

In these settings, expand the <kbd>More Options</kbd> button so that it's text turns into <kbd>Less Options</kbd>.

Now, edit the Java Executable field to your file path which you saved earlier. Run the game & see if it works. If it doesn't, double check your file path or try reinstalling Temurin.

### Prism Launcher/MultiMC
This part of the guide will use Prism Launcher for the example as it's the most optimised MultiMC fork.

Click your instance you would like to edit and press the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button on the Instance's pane.

From here, in the new popup navigate to <kbd>Settings</kbd> and enable your "Java Location" setting.

Edit the text in the text box to the file path in the screenshot you took earlier. Click the <kbd>Test</kbd> button to see if it works. If it doesn't, double check your file path or try reinstalling Temurin.
